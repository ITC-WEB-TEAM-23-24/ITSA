          Institute Technical Summer Activities aka ITSA is an annual program organized by ITC.
          The aim is to provide first-hand technical exposure over the period of summer vacations. 
          <br />
          It also serves as a platform where one explores a field not aligned with their own major. <br /> 
          Students are encouraged to also target some real-life problems that can be solved using technology.
